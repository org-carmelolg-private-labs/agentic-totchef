**Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License**

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. 

## Section 1 -- Definitions.

- **Adapted Material** means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation to a moving image. 
- **Copyright and Similar Rights** means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. 
- **Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. 
- **Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. 
- **Licensed Material** means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. 
- **Licensed Rights** means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. 
- **Licensor** means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. 
- **NonCommercial** means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange. 
- **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as making, importing or exporting copies, or sharing the Licensed Material with a third party. 
- **Sui Generis Database Rights** means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other equivalent rights anywhere in the world. 
- **You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your** has a corresponding meaning. 

## Section 2 -- Scope.

**2.1 Scope.** The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: 

a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and  
b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.  

**2.2 Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.** The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. 

**2.3 Duration.** The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 

**2.4 No downstream restrictions.** You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by recipients of the Licensed Material. 

## Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. 

**3.1 Attribution.**  
a. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:  
i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any individual(s) designated to be credited by the Licensor as author(s), editor(s), translator(s), illustrator(s), or otherwise for the Licensed Material (referred to hereafter as "Creditors");  
ii. a copyright notice;  
iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;  
iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;  
v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;  
b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and  
c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.  
For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material. 

**3.2 NonCommercial.**  
You may not exercise any of the Licensed Rights for Commercial purposes. 

**3.3 NoDerivatives.**  
If You Share the Licensed Material You make available only the Licensed Material as a whole and You do not modify the Licensed Material in any way. 

## Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: 

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;  
b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database or other collection in which You have or claim to have a Sui Generis Database Right, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and  
c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. 

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. 

## Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.** 

b. **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.** 

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. 

## Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. Upon expiration of the term specified in Section 2(b), the Licensed Rights granted under this Public License shall continue for so long as the Copyright and Similar Rights in the Licensed Material permits. 

b. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. 

c. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. 

## Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the "Licensor." Except for the limited purposes of Section 3(a), nothing in this Public License alters, waives, restricts, or is a substitute for any public domain dedication contained in the Licensed Material.
